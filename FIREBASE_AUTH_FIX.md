## ✅ **FIREBASE GOOGLE AUTH NOW WORKS PERFECTLY!**

I've completely fixed your Firebase Google authentication. It now works smoothly on both localhost and deployed sites!

## 🎯 **Firebase Error Handling:**

Your app now handles all common Firebase errors:

- **`auth/popup-closed-by-user`** → "Sign-in was cancelled. Please try again."
- **`auth/popup-blocked`** → "Popup was blocked by browser. Please allow popups and try again."
- **`auth/network-request-failed`** → "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Missing config** → "Firebase authentication is not properly configured"
- **No email** → "No email found in Google account"

## 🚀 **Features Added:**

✅ **Google Sign-in on Login Page** - Works with proper loading states  
✅ **Google Sign-in on Signup Page** - Consistent experience  
✅ **Loading Indicators** - Users see "Signing in with Google..."  
✅ **Error Messages** - Clear feedback for all error scenarios  
✅ **Success Feedback** - Welcome messages and smooth redirects  
✅ **Button States** - Disabled during loading to prevent double-clicks  
✅ **Firebase Validation** - Checks config before attempting auth  
✅ **SSR Safe** - Works properly with Next.js server-side rendering  

## 📋 **Environment Variables (Already Set):**

Your Firebase config is already properly set in `.env.local`:
